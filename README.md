<h1> <div align="center">Country Metric Visualizer</div> </h1>
This is a completed project on the course of Advanced Topics in Database Technology and Applications. The goal of this project, is to manage a large amount of data, which is filtered, processed and visualized on the user's demand. This project makes use of the JavaFX Library for the visualization, as well as some minor libraries for reading the requested documents.

<h1> <div align="center"> Set-Up </div> </h1>
Several things must be done before running the application. First, one should load the needed libraries that are used throughout the code:

<h3> ETL Libraries </h3>
<a href="https://poi.apache.org/">Apache POI (XML Reading)</a>

<h3> DDL and Visualization Libraries </h3>
<a href="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX</a><br>
MySQL Connector <br><br>

All libraries are included in a JAR form within the ETL-DDL-Libs folder, as well as the Javafx-sdk folder.

<h2> Download Data </h2>
The given ETL and DDL processes are used to process the instructed country data. Those data can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> and should be placed on a folder whose path is known to you. <br>
